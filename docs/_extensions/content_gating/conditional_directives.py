"""
Conditional directives for content gating.

Supports conditional rendering for:
- toctree directive (global and per-entry conditions)  
- grid-item-card directive

Usage examples:

Grid card with condition:
:::{grid-item-card} Title
:only: not ga

Content here
:::

Toctree with global condition:
::::{toctree}
:only: not ga
:hidden:
:caption: Section Title

document1.md
document2.md
::::

Toctree with inline conditions:
::::{toctree}
:hidden:
:caption: Section Title

document1.md
document2.md :only: not ga
document3.md :only: ea
::::
