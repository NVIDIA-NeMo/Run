## Architectural Principles

NeMo Run follows several key architectural principles that guide its design:

### ðŸ”„ **Separation of Concerns**
- **Configuration**: Separate from execution logic
- **Execution**: Environment-agnostic task execution
- **Management**: Independent experiment lifecycle management
- **Interface**: Clean CLI and programmatic interfaces

### ðŸŽ¯ **Type Safety**
- **Python Type Annotations**: Leveraged for validation and documentation
- **Runtime Validation**: Automatic parameter validation and error checking
- **IDE Support**: Full autocomplete and type checking support

### ðŸ”Œ **Extensibility**
- **Plugin Architecture**: Extensible system for custom functionality
- **Executor Abstraction**: Easy addition of new execution environments
- **Configuration Flexibility**: Support for custom configuration patterns

### ðŸ“Š **Reproducibility**
- **Metadata Capture**: Automatic experiment metadata preservation
- **Configuration Versioning**: Full configuration history and tracking
- **Artifact Management**: Comprehensive artifact collection and storage

### ðŸš€ **Scalability**
- **Distributed Execution**: Support for multi-node, multi-GPU experiments
- **Resource Management**: Intelligent resource allocation and cleanup
- **Parallel Processing**: Concurrent execution of independent tasks

## Design Patterns

NeMo Run employs several design patterns that make it powerful and flexible:

### **Builder Pattern**
Used in configuration objects (`run.Config`, `run.Partial`) to construct complex configurations step by step.

### **Strategy Pattern**
Implemented through the executor system, allowing different execution strategies for the same task.

### **Observer Pattern**
Used in experiment management for real-time status updates and log streaming.

### **Factory Pattern**
Applied in the CLI system for creating complex objects from simple string specifications.

### **Command Pattern**
Used in the CLI architecture to encapsulate command execution and provide rich interfaces.

## Key Abstractions

### **Configuration Objects**
- `run.Config`: Direct configuration objects that build to instances
- `run.Partial`: Partial configurations that build to callable objects
- `run.Script`: Configuration for script-based execution

### **Executors**
- `run.LocalExecutor`: Local execution with process isolation
- `run.DockerExecutor`: Containerized execution
- `run.SlurmExecutor`: HPC cluster execution
- `run.SkypilotExecutor`: Cloud platform execution

### **Packagers**
- `run.Packager`: Base packaging strategy
- `run.GitArchivePackager`: Git-based code packaging
- `run.PatternPackager`: Pattern-based file packaging
- `run.HybridPackager`: Combined packaging strategies

### **Experiments**
- `run.Experiment`: Main experiment management class
- Task dependencies and orchestration
- Metadata management and reconstruction

These concepts work together to provide a cohesive, powerful system for ML experiment management. Understanding these fundamentals will help you design effective workflows and make the most of NeMo Run's capabilities.
