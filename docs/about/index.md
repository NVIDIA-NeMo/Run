# About NeMo Run

NeMo Run is a comprehensive Python framework for configuring, executing, and managing machine learning experiments across diverse computing environments. Built with a focus on reproducibility, flexibility, and scalability, NeMo Run decouples experiment configuration from execution, enabling researchers and ML engineers to seamlessly transition between local development, cloud platforms, and high-performance computing clusters.

## What is NeMo Run?

NeMo Run provides a unified interface for ML experiment lifecycle management, addressing the common challenges of:

- **Configuration Management**: Complex, nested configurations for models, data, and training parameters
- **Execution Orchestration**: Running experiments across different environments (local, Docker, Slurm, Kubernetes, cloud)
- **Experiment Tracking**: Managing, monitoring, and reproducing experiments with full metadata preservation

The framework is built on three core pillars:
