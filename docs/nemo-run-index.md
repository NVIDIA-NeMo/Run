# NeMo Run Documentation

NeMo Run is a powerful tool designed to streamline the configuration, execution and management of Machine Learning experiments across various computing environments. NeMo Run has three core responsibilities:

::::{grid} 1 1 1 3
:gutter: 1 1 1 2

:::{grid-item-card} {octicon}`gear;1.5em;sd-mr-1` Configuration
:link: configuration
:link-type: ref
:link-alt: Configuration guide

Learn how to configure your ML experiments and environments.
:::

:::{grid-item-card} {octicon}`play;1.5em;sd-mr-1` Execution
:link: execution
:link-type: ref
:link-alt: Execution guide

Execute your configured experiments across various computing environments.
:::

:::{grid-item-card} {octicon}`graph;1.5em;sd-mr-1` Management
:link: management
:link-type: ref
:link-alt: Management guide

Manage and monitor your running experiments and results.
