## Use Case Implementation Patterns

### Pattern 1: Research to Production Pipeline

```python
# 1. Research Phase
with run.Experiment("research_phase") as exp:
    # Exploratory experiments
    exp.add(config1, name="baseline")
    exp.add(config2, name="improved")
    exp.add(config3, name="optimized")

    results = exp.run()

# 2. Validation Phase
with run.Experiment("validation_phase") as exp:
    # Rigorous validation
    exp.add(validated_config, name="production_candidate")

    validation_results = exp.run()

# 3. Production Phase
with run.Experiment("production_deployment") as exp:
    # Production deployment
    exp.add(production_config, name="live_system")

    production_results = exp.run()
```

### Pattern 2: Team Collaboration Workflow

```python
# Shared configuration repository
@dataclass
class TeamModelConfig:
    architecture: str
    hyperparameters: Dict[str, Any]
    validation_metrics: List[str]

    @classmethod
    def from_team_standard(cls, model_type: str):
        """Load team standard configuration."""
        return cls(**load_team_config(model_type))

# Individual researcher workflow
def researcher_workflow(experiment_name: str, model_type: str):
    """Standardized researcher workflow."""

    # Load team configuration
    config = TeamModelConfig.from_team_standard(model_type)

    # Customize for specific experiment
    config.hyperparameters.update({
        "learning_rate": 0.001,
        "batch_size": 64
    })

    # Execute with team standards
    with run.Experiment(experiment_name) as exp:
        exp.add(config, name="experiment")
        return exp.run()
```

### Pattern 3: Production Monitoring System

```python
# Production monitoring setup
class ProductionMonitor:
    def __init__(self, model_config, monitoring_config):
        self.model_config = model_config
        self.monitoring_config = monitoring_config

    def deploy_with_monitoring(self):
        """Deploy model with comprehensive monitoring."""

        with run.Experiment("production_deployment") as exp:
            # Model deployment
            exp.add(self.model_config, name="model_deployment")

            # Monitoring setup
            exp.add(self.monitoring_config, name="monitoring_setup")

            # Health checks
            exp.add(health_check_config, name="health_checks")

            return exp.run()

    def monitor_performance(self):
        """Monitor model performance in production."""

        with run.Experiment("performance_monitoring") as exp:
            # Performance metrics collection
            exp.add(metrics_config, name="metrics_collection")

            # Anomaly detection
            exp.add(anomaly_config, name="anomaly_detection")

            # Alerting
            exp.add(alerting_config, name="alerting")
