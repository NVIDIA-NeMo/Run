## Core Concepts

NeMo Run is built around three core responsibilities:

1. **Configuration** - Define your ML experiments using a flexible, Pythonic configuration system.
2. **Execution** - Run your experiments seamlessly across local machines, Slurm clusters, cloud providers, and more.
3. **Management** - Track, reproduce, and organize your experiments with built-in experiment management.

Each guide dives deep into these concepts with practical examples and best practices. Choose a guide above to get started!
