# Documentation Personas

Our documentation is for NeMo Run machine learning experiment management workflows consumed by personas like AI researchers, machine learning engineers, cluster administrators, and devops professionals. Common tools include: Ray, Kubernetes, notebooks, python, large language models, experiment management, distributed computing.

## Persona-Specific Guidelines

### For AI researchers
- Include details on data formats and schemas
- Document model validation methodologies clearly
- Specify computational requirements for processing
- Provide notebook examples with clear annotations
- Include metrics for model performance evaluation
- Document data preprocessing and feature engineering steps
- Explain hyperparameter tuning approaches

### For Machine Learning Engineers (mle-focused)
- Document model training pipelines completely
- Include details on environment setup and dependencies
- Provide testing and validation methodologies
- Explain model deployment workflows
- Document CI/CD integration for ML pipelines
- Include performance optimization techniques
- Provide examples of model serving configurations

### For Cluster Administrators
- Include complete deployment architectures
- Document security considerations thoroughly
- Provide detailed monitoring and maintenance procedures
- Include troubleshooting guides for common issues
- Document resource allocation recommendations
- Provide scaling guidelines for different workloads
- Include backup and disaster recovery procedures

### For DevOps Professionals
- Document infrastructure-as-code implementations
- Include automation workflows and templates
- Provide observability and monitoring setup
- Document CI/CD pipeline integrations
- Include security best practices for deployments
- Explain high availability configurations
- Document canary deployment and rollback procedures

## Writing Style by Persona

When writing for different personas, adjust your style:

- **AI researchers**: Focus on analytical concepts and model behavior
- **ML Engineers**: Emphasize implementation details and pipeline architecture
- **Cluster Admins**: Prioritize operational stability and system interactions
- **DevOps**: Focus on automation, reliability, and maintainability

Keep these personas in mind when drafting and evaluating documentation.
