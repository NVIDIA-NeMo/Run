1. Update the [versions1.json](mdc:docs/versions1.json) file with the user's provided version by adding a new entry at the top and updating preferred to false for the previous entry.
2. Update the [repo.toml](mdc:repo.toml) `version` to the latest version provided by the user.
2. Create a tag for the latest commit on the `main` branch in the format of "git tag docs-v{}.{}.{}`.
3. Push the tag.
4. Recap everything you did to prepare for the release.

If a user asks you to bump the version but hasn't provided a full version number, ask for clarification on the version number.
