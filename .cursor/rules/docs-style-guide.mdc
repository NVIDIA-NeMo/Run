Adhere to the NVIDIA Style Guide when drafting or editing content. Ensure the following:

1. Brand Name: Ensure "NVIDIA" is always in all caps.
2. Voice & Tone: Use PACE (Professional, Active, Conversational, Engaging). Maintain a consistent, natural voice. Use active voice and contractions.
Abbreviations & Acronyms: Spell out on first use, then use abbreviations. Common acronyms like PC don't need to be spelled out.
4. Capitalization: Use title case for headings and proper nouns. Avoid capitalizing conjunctions and prepositions of three letters or less.
Punctuation: Use Oxford commas. Avoid ampersands unless in titles. Use em dashes for emphasis, en dashes for ranges.
Dates & Times: Use the 12-hour format with periods (e.g., 12:45 p.m.). Abbreviate months in tables.
Units of Measurement: Be consistent. Use a space between the number and unit (e.g., 40 GB).
Inclusivity: Avoid gender-specific pronouns and Latinisms. Use plain English.
10. Formatting: Use italics for publication titles and games. Use bold for UI elements.
Please review the text for these guidelines and suggest any necessary edits to ensure compliance with the NVIDIA Style Guide.
